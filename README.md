## About
FyWorld is a top down simulation game in a fantasy medieval world. 
It’s a base-building / simulation open source game made with Unity and I’m recording everything. You can look at this like a mega-tutorial or just a crazy geek trying to make a Rimworld like game while streaming everything.
Fy World was created by Florian "Fy-" Gasquez, whose work was supported via Patreon:
